# About Project
A project for memorizing foreign words based on the flashcard and periodic learning repetition methods. 
Flashcard is an abstract two-sided card, the word in the userâ€™s native language is written on the hidden side,
and the word in the chosen language is written on another side.

# Build With
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

# Basic Instruction
Application is needed to be started on web server. Before starting need to configure settings
of application as link to database.
Go to 
**`src/main/resources/application.properties`**.
Our application uses PostgreSQL.

Application can be used in two ways.
First, simple backend application with HTTP/JSON requests and
Second, with simple front-end.

To start with front-end will be needed to install all compuslory node_modules
by following commands in terminal.

```
cd path/src/main/webapp/pocket
-npm install
-npm start
```

To start without front-end. Run LingoApplication in IDE.

Application has been tested by [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
In our repository can be found our simple postman scenario.
